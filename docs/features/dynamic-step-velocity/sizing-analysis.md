# Sizing Analysis - Dynamic Step Velocity

## Bounds
- Only StepButton.tsx and StepButton.module.css will be modified.
- No changes to backend, state management, or other components.

## Dependencies
- StepButton.tsx must support dynamic velocity assignment and visual update.
- StepButton.module.css must support CSS custom property for velocity intensity.

## Risks
- Low: UI logic only, no external dependencies or complex state changes.
- Minor: Ensuring click position is accurately mapped to velocity (Â±2 units tolerance).
- Minor: Accessibility (keyboard, screen reader) must remain unaffected.

## Effort Estimate
- Implementation: 1.5 hours
- Testing: 0.5 hours
- Buffer: 0.5 hours
- Total: 2.5 hours (rounded up to 3 hours)

## Feasibility
- S: <8h, low risk
- No blockers identified

## Sizing Decision
- Size: Small (S)
- Risk: Low
- Buffer: 20% included

## Approval Needed
- Confirm sizing, risk, and feasibility
