## ðŸŽ¯ Status
**Stage:** [4] **Next:** Implementation **Status:** âœ… **Risk:** L **Updated:** 2024-12-19 16:45

## Current: Implementation
Ready to begin development with detailed implementation plan:
- 7 tasks with specific file modifications and acceptance criteria
- 4 milestones from core encoding to production-ready feature  
- Clear dependencies, risk mitigation, and quality gates
- Estimated 14-20 hours with incremental validation

**Next Action:** Begin Task 1 - Custom URL-Safe Encoding Implementation

**Problem Analysis:**
- Current system uses direct `window.location.hash` assignment without browser history entries
- Users cannot use browser back/forward buttons to navigate through pattern changes
- Pattern changes replace current URL instead of creating history entries
- No undo/redo functionality for pattern modifications
- URL sharing works but lacks navigation context

**Project Context:**
- React/TypeScript drum machine with Web Audio API
- Current URL persistence via base64-encoded hash fragments (#pattern=...)
- Existing pattern encoding supports: BPM, swing, echo/reverb levels, kit, grid velocities
- Uses debounced URL sync (300ms) to prevent excessive updates
- No existing browser history integration

**Success Definition:**
- Browser back/forward buttons navigate through pattern changes
- Pattern modifications create new history entries (with debouncing)
- URL sharing preserves history navigation context
- Undo/redo functionality via browser history
- Maintain existing URL persistence and pattern encoding
- No breaking changes to current sharing functionality

**Key Constraints:**
- Must preserve existing URL pattern encoding system
- Debounced updates to prevent history spam  
- Maintain compatibility with existing shared URLs
- Performance: avoid excessive history entries during rapid changes
- **NEW:** Integration with existing Wouter router configuration

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium - Wouter hash router integration, simpler than custom browser history implementation

## Quick Reference
**Success Criteria:** Browser navigation, history entries, undo/redo functionality | **Constraints:** Existing URL compatibility, performance | **Next:** Requirements gathering with acceptance criteria

## Tooling Commands
**Package Manager:** pnpm | **Dev:** pnpm dev | **Test:** pnpm test | **Build:** pnpm build

## Decisions Log
- 2025-08-01 - Targeting browser history integration - User requested "history management"
- 2025-08-01 - Risk assessed as Medium - Browser history API complexity, state sync challenges
- 2025-08-01 - Preserve existing pattern encoding - No breaking changes to URL format
- **2025-08-01 - REVISED APPROACH:** Use Wouter's `useHashLocation` instead of low-level history API
- **2025-08-01 - RISK REDUCED:** From Medium to Low-Medium - leveraging existing router infrastructure

## Recovery Info
**Last Checkpoint:** Stage 0 setup at 2025-08-01
**Resume Instructions:** Read requirements.md and validate acceptance criteria before proceeding to Stage 1
